## The outro

Let's add an ending to the drum loop.

+ Add the `:drum_cymbal_open` sample at the end of your code, **outside** of the loop.

+ Press run to test your code. It doesn't sound very interesting, so let's also add a `:drum_snare_hard` sample.

+ Test your code. Notice that there's no `sleep` between the 2 outro samples, so they'll play at the **same time**.
