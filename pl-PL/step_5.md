## Challenge: Create your own drum loop

Can you use what you've learnt to create your own drum loop? Here are some ideas to help you:

+ You could change the drum samples used in your intro or outro. To see what samples are available, you can go to [jumpto.cc/sonic-pi-samples](http://jumpto.cc/sonic-pi-samples), or just type `sample :drum` and choose from the list that appears.
